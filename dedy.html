            <h2>Technology Innovation — Trends and Opportunities</h2>
            <p>Technology is moving at an incredible pace. We live in an amazing era where things like autonomous cars, personalized medicine and quantum computing are becoming real as we speak; Artificial Intelligence, crypto-currencies, advanced automation, deep learning and concepts like Universal Basic Income are about to reshape our world — what an exciting era to live! It is not feasible to summarize the trends of technology and opportunities for innovation in a single article. Instead, I am listing below the areas I find most exciting to watch — the most promising developments in the wider information technology spectrum. Here is my list:</p>

        <h3>1. Artificial Intelligence</h3>
        <p>Everybody is talking about Artificial Intelligence these days. And yes, in many cases, the topic is covered with exaggerations and hype. Fortunately, the overall A.I. progress and the pace of the underlying technological innovation easily justifies this hype. Consider the progress achieved in fields like Deep Learning and areas such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="natural">
        <h3>2. Natural User Interfaces</h3>
        <p>It’s all about seamless experiences: voice-driven interactions — not only voice commands, but more advanced, natural dialogues and forms of communication combining multiple signals in meaningful, streamlined experiences. Imagine being in your smart home, asking your digital assistance to ‘provide more information about this’, where ‘this’ is resolved automatically by your Digital Assistant, using gaze analytics via connected cameras. This way your Digital Assistant understands what you were looking at when you asked the question. Then, using object detection algorithms, concludes on the class of objects ‘this’ refers, to empower a natural and intelligent response and a meaningful conversation development.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="virtual">
        <h3>3. Virtual Reality</h3>
        <p>The VR technology is exploding. So are the opportunities for innovative experiences, use-cases and products. Content creation for VR is a great opportunity with significant startup activity worldwide. VR startups are working across multiple domains and business scenarios, including E-commerce, gaming, social applications, learning and education, healthcare, online VR environments and more. The next few years will bring impressive progress on all VR hardware, applications and VR content.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="augmented">
        <h3>4. Augmented Reality</h3>
        <p>Augmented reality is what we get when physical and digital worlds blend into a single experience. Typical examples are Microsoft HoloLens and Google Glass. Again, this is an area that will grow rapidly as the opportunity for innovation is unlimited: content experiences, content discovery, data exploration and visualizations, intelligent and contextual object annotation, dynamic physical world mapping and discovery, industrial applications for field workers — are just some examples of the applications which will empower the ways we understand our world.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="analytics">
        <h3>5. Analytics and Visualization</h3>
        <p>Data availability has exploded — modern corporations have access to vast amounts of complex data, both internal and from the public domain. The breadth and depth of data available, require new ways to summarize, visualize and present data. Novel ways to experience data and insights could involve intelligent interactive synopsis and ‘data navigation’ systems, VR and AR experiences, voice-driven insights discovery and ‘personalized data exploration’ scenarios. I do believe that there are great new ways to visually browse and understand data, discover and explore hidden structures, trends and patterns.</p>
